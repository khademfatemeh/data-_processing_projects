# Data Fragmentation
## Purpose
The project aimed to analyze and compare the efficiency of various data partitioning techniques on PostgreSQL, an open-source relational database management system. We developed a set of Python functions that enable the loading of input data into a relational table, partitioning the table using different horizontal fragmentation methods, and efficiently inserting new data into the appropriate partitions.
